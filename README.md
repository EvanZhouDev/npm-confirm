## What is `npmc`?

`npmc` is a wrapper for the `npm` command that *confirms with you if it detects you using another package manager*.

When confirming, you can choose to do 3 things:
1. Run your command, [**adapted for the new package manager**](#automatic-command-adaptation)
2. Run your **original command**
3. **Cancel** the operation 

Now, you can just copy and paste `npm install` commands from documentation without needing to manually edit the package manager!

<summary>Why not <code>@antfu/ni</code>?</summary>

When aliased to just `npm`, `npmc` serves as a quick way to run commands copied from external sources without needing to modify it at all, as opposed to `ni`, which reqires you to still swap out the `npm install` bit.

However, these tools can serve as compliments.
* If you are typing commands directly, you can still choose to use `ni`.
* You can use `npmc` in addition for copying and pasting or to catch occasional slipups.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g npm-confirm
```

This will give you access to the `npmc` command.

I recommend aliasing `npmc` to just `npm` so you can use `npm` like normal.

To do this in ZSH or Bash add this to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:

```bash
alias npm='npmc'
```

<summary>Wrapping <code>pnpm</code>, <code>bun</code>, and <code>yarn</code></summary>

You may also want the `pnpm`, `bun`, and `yarn` commands to give confirmation when used with the wrong package manager.

By default, `npmc` acts as `npm` when no other package managers are detected. However, you can change that default by simply passing a `--[NAME]-alias` flag.

For example, if I run `npmc --pnpm-alias`, it will act as `pnpm` and confirm with you if you are using a non-`pnpm` package manager.

Again, I recommend aliasing these in `.zshrc`:

```bash
# npm
alias npm='npmc'

# pnpm
alias pnpm='npmc --pnpm-alias'

# bun
alias bun='npmc --bun-alias'

# yarn
alias yarn='npmc --yarn-alias'
```

</details>

## Features

### Automatic Command Adaptation

`npmc` will automatically adapt agent subcommands and flags from one package manager to the other.

For example, NPM's `ci` command will automatically be converted to `bun install --no-save` for Bun, and accordingly for other package managers.

### Command Preview

`npmc` always shows you what command will be run, both when using the adapted package manager, or even the one you ran the command with.

This maximizes transparency, and ensures `npmc` never does something you didn't mean when adapting commands.

### Never Confirm List

`npmc` has a list of keywords, that when detected in your commands, won't trigger confirmation.

This includes `help`, `-v`, and more, so you can check docs or the version of another package manager without `npmc` bothering you.
